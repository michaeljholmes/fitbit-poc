IMVP
 - When is the competition actually created? We'll start by fixing start time.
 - Is the creator in the competition? Do we need toggle?
 - Need to show what happens at the end! Think about end of competition

Post IMVP
- Tidy up create competition form validation

Thoughts
 - Should we show the teams with the countdown?
 - Prevent user from manually creating team, AND then trying to send out a link. This could be done by using a button to generate a link.
 - Enforce google sign in only?

TODO
Trial authenticated endpoint and plug in

It might in time be worth seperating out steps from user.
