IMVP
 - When is the competition actually created? We'll start by fixing start time.
 - Is the creator in the competition? Do we need toggle?
 - Need to show what happens at the end!

Post IMVP
- Tidy up create competition form validation

Thoughts
 - Should we show the teams with the countdown?
 - Prevent user from manually creating team, AND then trying to send out a link. This could be done by using a button to generate a link.
 - Enforce google sign in only?

TODO
Trial authenticated endpoint and plug in
Sign user up on verification page

Next - fix verification, and loggedIn checks to hooks, tidy up hooks, make look a little nicer

It might in time be worth seperating out steps from user.
Need to decide what to do about paging
