          Welcome to Stride Wars, the ultimate step challenge where fitness
          meets fun and strategy! In this exhilarating competition, teams come
          together to battle it out in a quest for step supremacy. Each day,
          participants' steps are counted and synced from their smartphones,
          turning their everyday movements into a competition. But it's more
          than just a step count; it's a strategic game that requires teamwork,
          planning, and a bit of friendly rivalry.

          Stride Wars combines the typical step competition with the element of
          surprise and strategy.{" "}
          <strong>
            Through the use of power ups, the game can change quickly.
          </strong>{" "}
          Do you focus on defending your step count or do you attack other teams
          and make their steps more difficult to achieve?
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          You can keep track of what's happening across the{" "}
          <strong>competition in the Live Feed and leader board.</strong> You
          can witness which team is being more defensive and also keep an eye on
          which team is running away with the lead!
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          <strong>Your steps are automatically counted!</strong> With your
          smartphone or FitBit, you can set up your device and not have to worry
          about any administration, just focus on completing as many steps as
          you can each day and who you are going to target with your power ups.
